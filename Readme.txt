This project implements J. Cendrowski's algorithm in R.  The PRISM algorithm induces
classification rules for expert systems.  It finds the feature-value pair that
maximizes the information gain about a class.  It is an alternative to the ID3 decision 
tree algorithm.  

R code is provided in ruleEngineR2.r.  

Report.txt provides psuedo-code and implementation details.
